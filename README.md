# Why Is Your Code So Bad??
Ya about that... I am just 14 days into Java when I wrote this.
 This is my first, oh Second (My First is Hangman game) serious coding with Java and well let's just say you'll be able to tell.
 The project was not planned or designed very well before development began and therefore there is a lot of redundancy and just horribly written code.
 Anyways I think it's pretty good for a first oh, Second Try With Java! !
